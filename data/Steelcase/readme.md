# Steelcase
## Background
In the SaMoLEG (Saltwater Monitoring with Long Electrode Geoelectrics) project
we used steelcased boreholes as electrodes. Ronczka et al. (2015a) introduced
the Shunt Electrode Model (SEM) in a numerical study. We established a system
in a shallow aquifer system at Müllrose, Eastern Brandenburg, Germany and did
measurements every 3 months over a period of two years. Ronczka et al. (2015b)
demonstrate how saltwater, uprising from a salt dome, moves laterally at the
bottom of the aquifer.
