# Synthetic tracer injection
## Background
The pyGIMLi paper (Rücker et al. 2017) demonstrates how several processes
1. Darcy flow model by Finite Elements
2. Advection-dispersion transport modelling using Finite Volume
3. Petrophysical transformation to resistivity
4. ERT modelling
are combined in a single operator leading to a fully coupled hydrogeophysical
inversion. Here, we use the data as playground for timelapse inversion.

The synthetic modelling is described in detail in
https://www.pygimli.org/_examples_auto/5_misc/plot_hydrogeophysical_modeling.html
