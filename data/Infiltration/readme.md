# Natural rain infiltration
This example deals with long term monitoring of rain water infiltration into a
hillslope aquifers. The study was done by the University of Dresden who did the
weekly measurements in the test area at Mulda, close to Freiberg.
A combined Wenner and dipole-dipole array was measured with the lightweight
4 point light hp instrument from Lippmann electronics.

# Inversion
This is a classical example how easily artifacts can arise in the inversion
result, particularly for shallow infiltration as already shown by Descloitres
et al. (2003). Therefore it is a good playground for inversion strategies.
