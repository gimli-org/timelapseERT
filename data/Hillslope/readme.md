# Hillslope infiltration
## Background
This data set is on a controlled infiltration experiment described by Hübner
et al. (2017) at the same site already presented by Hübner et al. (2015), for
which the data are also available.

It represents one of the most extensive data sets available with 200 frames
measured every 30 minutes. A 3D grid of 392 electrodes was used with almost
3000 measurements so that more than 50000 single data points are present.
The quality of the data, measured with the Geotom instrument, is very good.

The results show the infiltration of water and its movement in the layers of
a hillslope catchment and allows hints to runoff and flood prediction.
