# ALERT
## Background
This data was published by Kuras et al. (2009) as one of the first references of
the ALERT (automated electrical time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography)
system developed at the British Geological Survey (BGS).

Here we focus on Experiment 2, described in section 3.3 of the paper monitoring
lateral tracer migration and compare the results with Fig. 7.
